# 🚢 Rock vs Mine Classification – Machine Learning Project(Logistic Regression)

A supervised machine learning project that classifies sonar signal data to determine whether an underwater object is a **Rock** or a **Mine**. This project demonstrates my ability to build an end-to-end ML pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Identifying underwater objects accurately is critical for marine navigation and defense applications. Using sonar signal patterns, this project trains a machine learning model to distinguish between:

- Rock (R)  
- Mine (M)
