# 🚢 Rock vs Mine Classification – Machine Learning Project (Logistic Regression)

A supervised machine learning project that classifies sonar signal data to determine whether an underwater object is a Rock or a Mine. This project demonstrates my ability to build an end-to-end ML pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.
🔍 Problem Statement
Identifying underwater objects accurately is critical for marine navigation and defense applications. Using sonar signal patterns, this project trains a machine learning model to distinguish between:
Rock (R)
Mine (M)
